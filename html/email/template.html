	<p>Folks,</p>
	<p>I'm super excited to tell you that my band, Observatory, was
	   selected out of hundreds of other acts to be a top ten finalist in
	   the Converse "Get Out of the Garage" contest.</p>

	<p>Needless to say, we're pretty stoked.  But we're hoping you can help
	   us out by voting (and getting your friends to vote) for us.</p>

	<p>The way it works is that people get to vote once a day until Jan
	   20th (this Thursday).  The band with the most votes wins.  The
	   winner gets sent on a tour and records an album.  If you want to see
	   us get out of the garage, here's the site to vote.  We're
	   Observatory:</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>If we get enough votes by Thursday, we will no doubt rule the galaxy.</p>

	<p>Also, if you want to keep track of what we're doing, we put our
	   music up on our website for download:</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <a href="http://observatorymusic.com/">http://observatorymusic.com/</a>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We also send out updates with new tracks and stuff we're working on via twitter:</p>
	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Thanks so much for your support.  If we win, you can come see us
	   live on the big tour!</p>
	<p>Cheers,</p>
	<p>&mdash;Orion</p>
